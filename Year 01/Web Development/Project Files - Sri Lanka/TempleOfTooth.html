					Sri Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a Buddhist temple in the city of Kandy, 
					Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the 
					relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local 
					politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. Kandy 
					was the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings and is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple.
					In the Central Highlands, almost dead centre in the little island of Sri Lanka lays Kandy City. 
					The crown jewel of the city is the famed Sri Dalada Maligawa, also known as the Temple of the Tooth. 
					‘Maligawa’ literally translates to palace, and the temple is part of the palace complex. The entire 
					complex is over three centuries old at least, and has seen many a king’s rise and fall. It has seen 
					bloody wars and peaceful reigns and is one of the most historical places still standing in the island.

				 <p class="para2">The golden-roofed Temple of the Sacred Tooth houses Sri Lanka’s most important Buddhist relic – a tooth of the Buddha. 
					Preserving the sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha in this haven of refuge, local tradition has, since time immemorial, 
					declared that whoever houses and protects the divine relic automatically is given the power to rule the country. While 
					somethings have changed, the symbolism remains powerful.The artifact serves as a significant symbol of Sinhalese identity 
					and pride and those in possession of the relic have a political, as well as a religious, dimension.Every day thousands of 
					white-clad pilgrims make their way to this hallowed space, bearing lotus blossoms and frangipani for their offerings and 
					prayers, known as pujas. It is essential that you are dressed appropriately, clothes must cover your legs and shoulders and, 
					before entering the holy temple your shoes must be removed.A visit to the Temple of the Sacred Relic Temple is a must when 
					you are in Kandy.  While the tooth stays hidden within a gold casket, visitors and devotees always visit the temple during 
					puja just to have a look at the well protected inner shrine where it is kept.Annually, during the Esala Perahera procession, 
					the relic casket gets paraded through the streets atop a male elephant. The 10-day festival is one of the largest Buddhist 
					festivals in the world and the most important in Sri Lanka. The temple is best visited in the morning or the evening when 
					the ceremonial offerings and prayers are given.During puja (offerings or prayers), the heavily guarded room housing the tooth 
					is open to devotees and tourists. However, you don’t actually see the tooth. It’s kept in a gold casket shaped like a dagoba 
					(stupa), which contains a series of six dagoba caskets of diminishing size.As well as the revered main temple, the complex includes a series 
					of smaller temples, shrines and museums.
