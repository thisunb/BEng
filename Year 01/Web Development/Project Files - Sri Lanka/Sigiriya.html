					The Lion Rock of Sigiriya is one of the most famous highlights in Sri Lanka. 
					The palace is located in the heart of the island between the towns of Dambulla 
					and Habarane on a massive rocky plateau 370 meters above the sea level.
					The main entrance is located in the northern side of the rock.
					It was designed in the form of a huge stone lion, whose feet have survived up 
					to today but the upper parts of the body were destroyed.Thanks to this lion the palace was 
					named Sigiriya. The term Sigiriya originates from the word Sihagri, i.e. Lion Rock.
					The photogenic rock is over 200 meters high and is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. 
					On top of this rock stood the palace of King Kasyapa in the 5th century. 
					You can still see the ruins of the palace at the top, from where you have an 
					amazing view over the vast green jungle. The rock owes its name to the lion, 
					carved in stone, which guards the stairs. Now only the legs are left. 
					At the foot of the rock you will find beautifully landscaped gardens, canals, 
					a small museum and countless monkeys roaming around. The climb up, via almost 
					1900 steps, is tough but well worth it. Halfway up you can make a stop at the 
					well-preserved murals of undressed women and at a smoothly polished mirror wall 
					in which the king could admire himself.
				</p>    
				 <p class="para2">The western wall of Sigiriya was almost entirely covered by frescoes, created during the reign of Kasyapa. 
						Eighteen frescoes have survived to this day.The frescoes are depicting nude females and are considered to 
						be either the portraits of Kasyapa’s wives and concubines or priestess performing religious rituals.
						Despite the unknown identity of the females depicted in the frescoes, these unique ancient paintings are 
						celebrating female beauty and have incredible historical significance.
						One of the most striking features of Sigiriya is its Mirror wall.
						In the old days it was polished so thoroughly that the king could see his reflection in it.
						The Mirror wall is painted with inscriptions and poems written by the visitors of Sigiriya.
						The most ancient inscriptions are dated from the 8th century.
						These inscriptions are proving that Sigiriya was a tourist destination more than a thousand years ago. Today, painting on the wall is strictly prohibited.
						Walking along the approach to Lion Rock, you pass through the remains of a once beautifully landscaped garden – with pools 
						and terraces. Ahead of the path the two-hundred metre high granite rock looms. And with each step my heart beat louder and 
						faster. At the base of the steps, the initial part of the ascent is by way of a brick staircase, and then it turns into an 
						iron staircase added to the side of the granite rock face.
